# Speech-to-arduino-command
This repository is based on the Speech to text repository https://github.com/turkiAlamir/T1-Speech-to-Text
with an additional connect button that asks the user to choose a port that is connected to an arduino
and once connected after starting and recording the speech will be written to the arduino 
and then the arduino will take the string of text and search for either the word "left" or "right" in arabic or english 
and if it's left then the servo motor's angle will be 0° and if  its right then the angle will be 180°
